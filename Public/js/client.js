The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant.

Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

Namely, we are interested in people's choices between a cooperative and a self-interested options, how they think about their choice, how they think about the other participant's choice, and how they think about the choice making process.</p><p>This was investigated using a single-shot (you only played once), normal form (both participants played simultaneously), double-choice (you chose between two options) <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma' target='_blank'>prisoner's dilemma.</a></p><p> One of the options you were presented with was a cooperative choice (it could lead to a better outcome for both you and the other participant if they also cooperate) and the other option was a self-interest choice (it would generally lead to a better outcome for you, but a worse one for the other participant).</p><p>This was an experimental condition to test if levels of cooperation, and thoughts about the decision-making process, are influenced by the possibility of one's choice being detected by the other player. This was to investigate this <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043463119885102' target='_blank'>theory about cooperation in social dilemmas (such as prisoner's dilemmas).</a></p>";
