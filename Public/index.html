				<h4>What happens if I take part?</h4>
				<p>
					This study is about a multiplayer game where you will be paired with another anonymous participant. Your task will be to make one of two choices. The other participant you are paired with will have the same options to choose from. The outcome of the game will depend on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. You will also be asked to answer some questions about the study. The outcome will determine the size of your bonus reward (from £0.10 to £0.70), which is in addition to your participation fee of £1.00. Therefore, in total, you will earn between £1.10 and £1.70. Please note that before starting the study, you may have to wait a little while until you are paired with another participant.
